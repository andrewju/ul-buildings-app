          <p style="line-height: 25px;" align="left" > Silver Apples Cr&egraveche was completed in 1999. Located centrally and with an area of 381m2, the cr&egraveche was built primarily to look after the children of UL students and staff. The purpose-built cr&egraveche was officially opened in January 2000 by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr John O'Donoghue. The cr&egraveche provides a full-day care service to the pre-school children of UL staff and students. The children are given breakfast, a morning snack, dinner and afternoon tea.  <br><br>
    

          Silver Apples Cr&egraveche is a purpose -built creche, located on-site at the University of Limerick Campus. The cr&egraveche was officially opened in January 2000 by the then Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform, Mr John O'Donoghue. The cr&egraveche is designed to provide a full day care service to the pre school children of staff and students at the University. <br><br> Where did the name come from: <br>
The cr&egraveche takes its name from the poem Song of Wandering Aengus by the famous Irish poet W.B. Yeats: "And pluck till time and times are done, the silver apples of the moon, the golden apples of the sun". This line from the poem is carved on the foundation stone of the University, which is located not far from the cr&egraveche itself.</p>
